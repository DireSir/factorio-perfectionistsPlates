# Perfectionist's plates

Have you ever noticed that copper and iron plates are not aligned? No? Me neither. But after seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Factoriohno/s/2rH6vwGqgG) comment on reddit, and entering a blind blood rage as a consequance of realizing that, I wanted to fix this. At least, give an option to fix this for all the perfectionists out there. So here you go. a simple mod that replaces the texture of copper plates with a properly alligned one. Sorry for requiring a restart to change the settings - I do not yet know how to do something like this during the runtime, if that is even possible. If you have any ideas or requests, feel free to contact me on discord, telegram or reddit. If you want to contribute, feel free to open a pull request on github.

## Install guide (copied from my other in-development mod)

At the moment, this mod can only be installed manually. Why? Simple answer: I'm a broke-ass teenager, and as an indirect consequence of that, I am unable to upload the mod to the mod portal. You can figure out why exactly yourself... This said, here's how to install it:

1. **Download the mod**
    - Click the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".

2. **Rename the archive**
    - Double-click the archive to open it (or extract it), open the folder that shares the name with the archive, find the info.json file and open it. Note the the `name` and `version` fields.
    - Rename the mod folder or archive to match the format: `<name>_<version>` (e.g., `Perfectionists-plates_0.1.0`).
    - ⚠️ **Important**: Make sure the name matches exactly, or Factorio will fail to start.

3. **Install the mod**
    - Move the renamed folder or archive into your Factorio `mods` directory. It is usually located at: `C:/Users/<your username>/AppData/Roaming/Factorio/mods`.  
    - Start or restart Factorio to load the mod!
    - You can see if factorio has loaded the mod by looking for it in the "Mods" tab.
