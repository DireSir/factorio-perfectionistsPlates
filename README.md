# Perfectionist's plates

Have you ever noticed that copper and iron plates are not aligned? No? Me neither. But after seeing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Factoriohno/s/2rH6vwGqgG) comment on reddit, and entering a blind blood rage as a consequance of realizing that, I wanted to fix this. At least, give an option to fix this for all the perfectionists out there. So here you go. a simple mod that replaces the texture of copper plates with a properly alligned one. Sorry for requiring a restart to change the settings - I do not yet know how to do something like this during the runtime, if that is even possible.
